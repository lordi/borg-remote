# Borg Remote To Local
![alt text](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_static/logo.png "Borgbackup")

## Description

[BorgBackup](https://github.com/borgbackup) does not have support yet for
backing up a remote server to a local destination (or a destination that we can
only access from local). The workaround mentioned in the docs is via `sshfs`
which is very slow.

This repository contains a Docker image for a local borg server and a script
that will spin up the borg server, connect to a remote SSH server and backup
your files via a SSH tunnel to the local borg server. This way, the file
collector will be fast as it runs on the remote server but the backup will
still be stored locally.

Based on [grantbevis/borg-server](https://github.com/grantbevis/borg-server).

## Requirements

Local requirements:

 * Docker
 * Docker Compose

Remote requirements:

 * borg
 * generated ssh key (e.g. `~/.ssh/id_rsa`)

## Usage

 1. Copy `.env.default` to `.env` and fill out the details.
 2. Run `backup.sh`

## Disclaimer

Use at your own risk, this is highly experimental.
